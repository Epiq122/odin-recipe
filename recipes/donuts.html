    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      These are yummy, glazed chocolate donuts without frying! My family loved
      these! I don't fry anything, so was happy to find this recipe. You can
      also sprinkle these with toppings after dipping into the glaze.
    </p>

      <li>cooking spray</li>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>2 egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Glaze:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons corn syrup</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 ounce bittersweet chocolate, chopped</li>
      <li>1 ounce semisweet chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Coat 11 donut cups
        with cooking spray.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt
        together in a bowl. Beat in 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk, eggs, 2
        tablespoons melted butter, and vanilla extract using an electric mixer
        until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into a resealable plastic bag; cut off 1 corner. Pour batter
        into donut cups, filling each to about 3/4 full.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a donut comes
        out clean, about 10 minutes. Cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine 1/4 cup butter, cream, milk, corn syrup, and vanilla
        extract in a small saucepan over medium-low heat until butter is
        completely melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Reduce heat to low; stir in
        bittersweet and semisweet chocolate until melted, 2 to 3 minutes more.
        Remove from heat, whisk in confectioners' sugar until combine
      </li>
      <li>Dip cooled donuts into glaze; cool and set, about 15 minutes.</li>
